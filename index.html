                Stan Lee also known as Stanley Martin Lieber was an American comice book writer, editor, publisher, and producer.
                He rose through the ranks of family-run business to become Marvel Comics primary creative  leader for two decades, leading
                its expansion from a small division of a publishing house to a multimedia corporation that dominated the comics industry.
                In collaboration with others at Marvel particularly cowriter/artist Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko he co-operated numerous popular
                fictional characters, including superheros Spider-Man, the X-Man, Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk, Black widow, The Fantastic Four, Black
                Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch and Ant-Man. The superheros he created seemed more meaningful and realistic.
